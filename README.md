## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 12.x or higher) installed on your machine. This will include npm (Node Package Manager), which is necessary for managing the project's dependencies.

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manojmanikandan7/PennyWise.git
   cd into the folder
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the required packages.

### Running the Development Server

With the dependencies installed, you can now start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Vite development server. You should see output in the terminal indicating the URL at which the application is running (usually http://localhost:3000).

### Building for Production

To build your application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vite will compile your application and output the static files to the `dist` directory, optimized for best performance.

### Linting the Project

Run the following command to lint your project files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will check your code for any linting errors and enforce code style based on the project's ESLint configuration.
